# AniSkip - MPV Anime Opening Skipper


AniSkip is an MPV plugin that automatically skips anime openings based on chapter names and allows quick navigation to the next chapter.

## Features

*   **Auto-Skip Openings:** Skips openings using chapter names.
*   **Next Chapter Hotkey:** `Ctrl + Right Arrow` (default) jumps to the next chapter, if there is no chapter or skip is too big, skips 90 seconds forward.
  

## Installation
1. Place `AniSkip.lua` in your MPV scripts directory:
   - **Linux/macOS**: `~/.config/mpv/scripts/`
   - **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\mpv\scripts\`

2. Unbind `Ctrl + Right Arrow` inside `input.conf`.

3. Restart MPV.
